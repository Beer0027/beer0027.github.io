            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Barret Beermann. I am a graduate of the <abbr title="Bachelor's of Hospitality and Tourism Management">BHTM</abbr> program from Algonquin College and I am <em>currently</em> a 1<sup>st</sup> level <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> student. I have enrolled in this program because I am interested in pursuing coding professionally, but I am also interested in learning other aspects of media design such as digital graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
                The reason that I became interested in coding was because of the <abbr title="Computer Science">CompSci</abbr> class I took in high school. We explored c&#35; using Visual Studio (thankfully we are using it in this class). I learned how to code little programs and mini games, but I <em>definitely</em> couldn't do that anymore.
